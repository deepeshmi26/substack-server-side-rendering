# Understanding Hydration in Next.js

Hydration is the process that makes your website interactive after it loads. Let's break this down with a simple explanation:

## What Happens During Hydration?

1. First, Next.js sends HTML to the browser (like a static snapshot of your page)
2. Then, JavaScript loads and "hydrates" this HTML by:
   - Adding event listeners (like click handlers)
   - Connecting your React components
   - Making the page interactive

## Why is Hydration Important?

- Users see content quickly (thanks to the initial HTML)
- The page becomes interactive once JavaScript loads
- Provides better performance than loading everything at once
