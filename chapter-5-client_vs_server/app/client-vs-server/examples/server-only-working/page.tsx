      <p>Rendered entirely on the server â€” no JS bundle, no interactivity.</p>

          <li>
            You&apos;ll see the first request returns a bare HTML document with
            basic layout but no interactivity. Why? Because react server cannot
            send onClick functions in html.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note: When navigating through links, this network request will not
            be visible as only RSC payload requests happen on routing. This will
            be covered later.

      <InstructionBlock instructions="Server components are like regular JavaScript functions that return an HTML document. Just like a static HTML document cannot have functions attached to it, server components cannot have interactive functions like onClick handlers - they can only return static markup." />
