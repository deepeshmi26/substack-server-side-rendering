# 🌐 Chapter 4.a - API Routes in Next.js

## 🎯 What are API Routes?
API Routes in Next.js allow you to build backend API endpoints directly within your Next.js application. They provide a seamless way to handle server-side logic alongside your frontend code.

## 💡 Key Features
- Built directly into Next.js
- Run on the server-side
- Support all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Located under `app/api/**` directory
- Accessed via `/api/**` endpoints

## ✅ Use Cases
1. **Lightweight Backend Logic**
   - Form submissions
   - Simple data transformations
   - Basic CRUD operations

2. **API Proxying**
   - Forward requests to external APIs
   - Add authentication layers
   - Cache external API responses

3. **Serverless Functions**
   - Handle webhooks
   - Process payments
   - Send emails

## ⚠️ Limitations
1. **Not Suitable For**
   - Heavy computational tasks
   - Complex database operations
   - Long-running processes
   - File system operations

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Cold starts in serverless environments
   - Limited execution time
   - Memory constraints
